## Load Packages

In this section, we install and load the necessary packages. 

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, include = FALSE}
### Install packages. If you haven't install the following package, please uncomment the line below to install it. Then, comment it back before knitting the document.
#install.packages("ggplot2")

### load libraries for use in current working session
library('dplyr')
library('ggplot2')

## Import Data

In this section, we import the necessary data for this lab.

```{r import, include=FALSE}
### set your working directory
# use setwd to set your working directory

# you can also go to session-> set working directory -> choose directory
# working directory is the path to the folder and not file

# make sure the path of the directory is correct, i.e., where you have stored your data

setwd("~/Documents/MGT 585/Data")

### import data file
# read the files using read.csv
fueldata <- read.csv(file = "fueldata.csv")

```

# Fuel Efficiency Case

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Fuel Economy Guide provides fuel efficiency data for cars and trucks. A sample of the data for 311 compact, midsized, and large cars is provided in *fueldata.csv*.

The *Class* column identifies the size of the car; Compact, Midsize, or Large. 
The *Displacement* column shows the engine’s displacement in liters. 
The *FuelType* column shows whether the car uses premium (P) or regular (R) fuel, and 
the *HwyMPG* column shows the fuel efficiency rating for highway driving in terms of miles per gallon. 

As a Business Analyst, you are asked to use this data to predict the fuel efficiency for highway driving given the engine’s displacement. 

Do the following tasks and answer the questions according to the tasks' output.

## Task 1: Explore your data
Explore the dataset using 5 functions: dim(), str(), colnames(), head() and tail(). Convert any column that is supposed to be treated as a factor.

```{r explore}

# Explore the dataset using 5 functions: dim(), str(), colnames(), head() and tail()
dim(fueldata)
str(fueldata)
colnames(fueldata)
head(fueldata)
tail(fueldata)

# Convert any column that is supposed to be treated as a factor 
fueldata$FuelType <- as.factor(fueldata$FuelType)
fueldata$Class <- as.factor(fueldata$Class)
```

**Question 1**: How many observations and variables are in fueldata dataset? Which variables are numerical and which ones are categorical?


**ADD YOUR RESPONSE HERE**
We have 311 observations and 5 variables. Car and HwyMpg are numerical while displacement column is an Integar. And Class and FuelType columns are Categorical.


## Task 2: Run descriptive statistics
Compute descriptive stats (mean and standard deviation) for Displacement and HwyMPG for each Class as well as the overall correlation between Displacement and HwyMPG (NOT for each Class). Feel free to use dplyr functions if needed.

```{r descriptive}

# Descriptive stats for Displacement and HwyMPG for each Class

# Displacement

fueldata %>% group_by(Class) %>% summarise(mean=mean(Displacement), sd=sd(Displacement))


# HwyMPG

fueldata %>% group_by(Class) %>% summarise(mean=mean(HwyMPG), sd=sd(HwyMPG))


# Compute correlation between Displacement and HwyMPG

fueldata %>% summarise(correlation=cor(Displacement,HwyMPG))


```

**Question 2**: Which Class has the *highest* mean Highway MPG? Which Class has the *lowest* variability in Highway MPG? Explain.

**ADD YOUR RESPONSE HERE**
"Midsize" has 29.4 mean which is the highest mean Highway MPG. and "Large" has the lowest (0.502) variablity as compare to other classes.



**Question 3**: What is the *correlation* between Displacement and HwyMPG? Does that imply a positive, negative or no relationship? Is the relationship strong? Explain.

**ADD YOUR RESPONSE HERE**
The correlation between Displacement and HwyMPG is -0.833. Which suggests that both have strong negative relationship. As the Engine Displacement liters Increases, the Fuel highway MGT decreases.



## Task 3: Visualization 
Take HwyMPG as a response (dependent variable) and Displacement as a predictor (independent variable). 

Use ggplot() from ggplot2 package to create scatter plots of Displacement and HwyMPG. 


```{r plot}

### scatter plot of Displacement and HwyMPG
ggplot(fueldata, mapping = aes(x= Displacement, y= HwyMPG)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "Green") +
  ggtitle("Impact of Displacement on HwyMPG") +
  xlab("Displacement") +
  ylab("HwyMPG") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))




```

**Question 4** What does the scatter plot show? Write one line.


**ADD YOUR RESPONSE HERE**
As the Engine Displacement in liters Increases, the Fuel highway driving in terms of miles per gallon decreases.




## Task 4:	Simple Linear Regression
Take HwyMPG as a response (dependent variable) and  Displacement as a predictor (independent variable) and run regression analyses as instructed below.

*Task 4.1*: First, use lm() to run a regression analysis on Displacement as X and HwyMPG as Y. Then, use function summary() to summarize the regression analysis.

```{r regression}

# The impact of Displacement on HwyMPG

# X is Displacement
# Y is HwyMPG

## Regression Analysis
reg <- lm(HwyMPG~Displacement, data = fueldata)
summary(reg)

```

**Question 5**: How do you interpret the results? Interpret (1) the coefficient estimates, (2) p-value for beta1, (3) R-squared , and (4) p-value for F-statistics.

**ADD YOUR RESPONSE HERE**
First, the estimate for the intercept and slope are beta0 = 35.3950, beta1 = -2.8821. This means 1 liter increase in Displacement leads to 0.80138 unit decrease in fuel efficiency rating in HwyMPG.

Second, p-value for beta1 is < 0.05, therefore Displacement has a significant impact on HwyMPG.  

Third, R-squared is 0.6945 and it means that we can explain 69.45% of variance in our data with this model. 

Finally, p-value for F-statistics is < 0.05. therefore at least one of the coefficients are non-zero, and the model is valid. 



*Task 4.2*: Then, use the regression model developed in the previous code chunk to predict the HwyMPG for *Displacement = 3*.

```{r predict}

## Predict HwyMPG using the predict function for Displacement = 3
# choosing the new value for Displacement

# predict HwyMPG using the predict function
Displacement_new <- data.frame(Displacement = 3)
predict(reg , newdata = Displacement_new)
```

**Question 6**: What is the predicted highway MPG for *Displacement = 3*? 

**ADD YOUR RESPONSE HERE**
The predicted Highway MPG for Displacement = 3 is 26.74877.
